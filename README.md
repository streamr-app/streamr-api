# Streamr
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/streamr-app/streamr-api.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/streamr-app/streamr-api)

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Endpoints

Since this project is still under development, the Pawfile will be the most up to date
source of information regarding endpoints. If there is ever any question about how an endpoint works,
or what sort of response you should be receiving, you can always check the tests in the `/test/controllers` directory.

## Contributing

To contribute, put your changes inside a separate branch. Write some tests for it, validate
that they work by running `mix test`, and ensure that your changes match our styleguide by
running `mix dogma`. If everything passes, open up a Pull Request for review!

Travis CI is used to help ensure that no failing test or bad style gets past a review. If you
haven't tested your code or linted it, Travis CI will catch it.
